## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [c4-to-eventcatalog](skills/c4-to-eventcatalog/) | Converts C4 architecture models (Structurizr DSL/JSON, C4-PlantUML, Mermaid C4, diagrams, or architecture descriptions) into an EventCatalog mapping plan, then hands off to catalog-documentation-creator to generate or update catalog files. |
| [catalog-documentation-creator](skills/catalog-documentation-creator/) | Generates EventCatalog documentation files (services, agents, events, commands, queries, domains, flows, channels, containers) with correct frontmatter, folder structure, and best practices. |
| [code-to-catalog](skills/code-to-catalog/) | Scans a codebase, grills you interview-style on the architectural model (domains, services, agents, messages, boundaries), produces a plan file, then hands off to catalog-documentation-creator. Works for new catalogs and for reconciling existing catalogs with drifted code. |
| [custom-pages-and-apis](skills/custom-pages-and-apis/) | Builds custom pages and API routes inside your EventCatalog (Scale plan) — Astro pages and TypeScript endpoints in your catalog's `pages/` folder, using the stable `@catalog/layouts` and `@catalog/utils` toolkit, wired into the navigation. |
| [flow-wizard](skills/flow-wizard/) | Interactive, conversational skill that guides you through documenting business and agent flows step-by-step, cross-referencing your existing catalog resources. |

**Document an agent:**
> "Document my Order Support Agent that receives OrderCancelled events, reads the orders database, and uses Zendesk MCP tools"

**Create a full domain:**
> "Create a Payments domain with a PaymentService, PaymentProcessed event, and ProcessPayment command"

**Document from your codebase:**
> "Look at my src/ directory and generate EventCatalog documentation for the services and events you find"

**Map a C4 model:**
> "Use this Structurizr DSL file to map our C4 model into my existing EventCatalog"

**Add a business flow:**
> "Document the checkout flow from cart submission through payment processing to order confirmation"

**Map an agent workflow:**
> "Map the fraud review flow where the FraudReviewAgent checks risk signals before payment capture"

**Scaffold a new catalog:**
> "I don't have an EventCatalog yet, help me create one and document my architecture"
